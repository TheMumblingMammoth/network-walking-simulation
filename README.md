# network-walking-simulation
an ongoing simulator of pedastrians' walking in network, gathering SINR data

an asset folder is like it is in Unity project (this is a single scene simulation)

the goal of ongoing improvements is maxing out customizability of simulation
currently you can change ranges of users' speed and trembling, their routes, proportions of the number of users on different paths, and the intensity of the appearance of new users

to gather generated data press "output" button, it will generate an .csv file with SINR mapped on timeframe
